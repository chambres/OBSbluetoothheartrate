First run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then run:
`py BLEHRMonitor.py`
in the directory that you downloaded the file to.


Special thanks to [ukBaz](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72541361) for the actual heart rate code. I just combined this with OBS.

In OBS, add a text source, then choose the hr.txt as the source, located in the same directory as the program.
