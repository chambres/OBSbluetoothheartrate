# OBSbluetoothheartrate

First run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Replace the MAC Address of the device located at the bottom of `py BLEHRMonitor.py` you are using, and then the file.

Special thanks to [ukBaz](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72541361) for the actual heart rate code. I just combined this with OBS.

In OBS, add a text source, then choose the hr.txt as the source, located in the same directory as the program.
